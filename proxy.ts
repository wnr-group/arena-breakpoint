   * Server actions verify their own caller, so they skip this gate.

   * A server action POSTs to the page it was called from, which means it used
   * to pay for two auth round trips: this middleware's getUser(), and then
   * requireStaff()'s. On a database a hundred milliseconds away that doubled
   * the fixed cost of every admin operation, and the dashboard issues four at
   * once.
   *
   * Skipping is safe because it is not what protects them: every one of the
   * admin server actions calls requireStaff() or requireAdmin() itself, which
   * is the check that actually decides. Redirecting a POST here was never
   * useful either - a login page returned to an action call is not something
   * the customer or the staff member ever sees.
   *
   * IF YOU ADD AN ADMIN SERVER ACTION, IT MUST CALL requireStaff() OR
   * requireAdmin(). There is no longer a middleware backstop behind it.
