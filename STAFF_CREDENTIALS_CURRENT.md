```

-- Create a new staff user
INSERT INTO admin_users (username, password_hash, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  'newstaff@breakpoint.com',
  crypt('NewPassword@123', gen_salt('bf', 10)),
  'New Staff Name',
  'staff',
  true
);
```

### Option 3: Via Admin Panel (Future Enhancement)
Currently not available via UI. Use SQL or seeding script.

## 🔑 Password Reset (Emergency)

If you forget a password, reset via SQL:

```sql
-- Reset admin password
UPDATE admin_users
SET password_hash = crypt('NewPassword@123', gen_salt('bf', 10))
WHERE username = 'admin@breakpoint.com';

-- Reset staff password
UPDATE admin_users
SET password_hash = crypt('NewPassword@123', gen_salt('bf', 10))
WHERE username = 'staff@breakpoint.com';
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY REMINDERS

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Always change default passwords in production
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Follow password requirements strictly
3. **Limit Staff Access**: Only give staff role to trusted employees
4. **Monitor Login Activity**: Check `last_login_at` column regularly
5. **Deactivate Unused Accounts**: Set `is_active = false` for former employees
