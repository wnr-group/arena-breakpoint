          Please arrive a few minutes before your slot so we can seat you on time. Your session runs

          a session into a slot that another guest has booked.

          If you come without a booking, we will seat you if a station is free. Your time is counted
          from when we seat you until you finish, and you pay for the time you have actually played.
