# Staff Login Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The staff login feature has been successfully implemented in the Breakpoint Arena codebase. Staff users now have access to all admin features **except the Reports page**.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based User System**
- Two roles: `admin` and `staff`
- Roles stored in Supabase Auth user metadata
- Backward compatible (existing users default to admin)

### 2. **Access Control**
- **Admin**: Full access to all pages including Reports
- **Staff**: Access to all pages EXCEPT Reports
- Reports page shows "Access Denied" for staff with auto-redirect

### 3. **UI Enhancements**
- **Sidebar**: Dynamically hides Reports menu item for staff
- **TopBar**: Shows role badge (admin/staff) next to user name
- **Login**: Displays role in welcome message

### 4. **Seeding Scripts**
- `npm run seed:admin` - Create admin user
- `npm run seed:staff` - Create staff user
