 *
 * The role is read from `app_metadata` only. `user_metadata` is writable by the
 * user themselves via supabase.auth.updateUser(), so trusting it would let any
 * signed-in staff member promote themselves to admin.
 *
 * Memoised per request: getUser() is a network call to the auth server, so an
