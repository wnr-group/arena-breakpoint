 * session has no chosen duration at all - it is worth whatever the gap between
 * check-in and checkout turns out to be, so the arithmetic happens once, at
 * checkout, from two timestamps the database generated.
 *
 * The rate and the rounding are the existing ones: whole rupees for the station,
 * and each extra player's share rounded before they are added up. Only the
 * duration is new, and it is billed to the exact minute rather than rounded up to
 * the next half hour - 2h45m is charged as 2.75 hours.
