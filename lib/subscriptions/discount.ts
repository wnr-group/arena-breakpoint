/**
 * The single place a membership discount is resolved and valued.
 *
 * "Membership" and "subscription" are the same thing here - the schema calls it a
 * subscription (`subscriptions` -> `subscription_plans.discount_percentage`), so
 * that name is kept throughout rather than introducing a second vocabulary for
 * one concept.
 *
 * Both the device-booking and the food-order quote call in here, so a customer
 * gets the same percentage off whichever they are buying, and there is only ever
 * one definition of "is this membership actually usable".
 *
 * Server-side only: every caller runs inside a server action and reads through
 * `supabaseAdmin`. Nothing the browser sends is consulted.

/**
 * Looks up the caller's membership by phone number and returns its percentage.
 *
 * A membership only counts when all three hold, which is what separates an
 * activated membership from a lapsed or switched-off one:
 *
 *  - the customer record still points at it (`active_subscription_id`), so a
 *    membership that has been replaced or detached stops applying immediately;
 *  - its status is `active` - `expired` and `cancelled` are both excluded, which
 *    covers a membership an admin has switched off by hand; and
 *  - `end_date` has not passed. The column is a DATE and the comparison is made
 *    against today's date, so the membership stays usable for the whole of its
 *    final day rather than dying at midnight UTC.
 *
 * A missing customer, a missing plan or a query failure all resolve to "no
 * membership" rather than throwing: failing to find a discount must never block a
 * purchase, it just means the customer pays the undiscounted price.
